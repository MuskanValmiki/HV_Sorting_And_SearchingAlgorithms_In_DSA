#here we are sorting array by using InsertionSort

Q.Here we define what is Insertion Sort? 
Ans.Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted 
element at its suitable place in each iteration.

Q.what is the algorithms of Insertion sort?
Ans.here i define what is the algorithms of Insertion sort-
array=[5,9,2,7,8,4,3]#this is our array.

#here we start to doing Insertion sort.
The first element in the array is assumed to be sorted. 
Take the second element and store it separately in key.
Now, the first two elements are sorted. Take the third element 
and compare it with the elements on the left of it.
Similarly, place every unsorted element at its correct position.

array=[5,9,2,7,8,4,3]
array=[2,5,9,7,8,4,3]
array=[2,5,7,9,8,4,3]
array=[2,5,7,8,9,4,3]
array=[2,4,5,7,8,9,3]
array=[2,3,4,5,7,8,9]
