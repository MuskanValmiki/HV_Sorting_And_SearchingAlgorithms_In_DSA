#here we are sorting array by using Merge Sort

Q.Here we define what is Merge Sort? 
Ans.Merge Sort is one of the most popular sorting algorithms 
that is based on the principle of Divide and Conquer Algorithm.

Q.what is the algorithms of Merge sort?
Ans.here i define what is the algorithms of Merge sort-
array=[6, 5, 12, 10, 9, 1]#this is our array.

#here we start to doing Merge sort.
a problem is divided into multiple sub-problems. 
Each sub-problem is solved individually.
Finally, sub-problems are combined to form the final solution.

Suppose we had to sort an array A. A subproblem would be to sort 
a sub-section of this array starting at index p and ending at 
index r, denoted as A[p..r].

Divide-If q is the half-way point between p and r, 
then we can split the subarray A[p..r] into two 
arrays A[p..q] and A[q+1, r].

Conquer-In the conquer step, we try to sort both the subarrays 
A[p..q] and A[q+1, r]. If we haven't yet reached the base case, 
we again divide both these subarrays and try to sort them.

Combine-When the conquer step reaches the base step and we get 
two sorted subarrays A[p..q] and A[q+1, r] for array A[p..r], 
we combine the results by creating a sorted array A[p..r] from 
two sorted subarrays A[p..q] and A[q+1, r].
