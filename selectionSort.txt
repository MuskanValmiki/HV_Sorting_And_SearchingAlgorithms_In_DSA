#here we are sorting array by using SelectionSort.
Q.here we define what is selection sort?
ans.Selection sort is another sorting technique in which we find the minimum element in every iteration and place it in the array beginning from the first index.
Thus, a selection sort also gets divided into a sorted and unsorted subarray.

Q.what is the algorithms of selection sort?
ans.here i define what is the algorithms of selection sort-
array=[3,2,5,7,1,8]#this is our array.

#here we start to doing selection sort.
In selection sort we have to put small element first.
which element we get small we just replace that element to small element place.
In this we just took small element and compare to all and which is sutable position we put.
In this we use nested loop.
This is my algorithms.
Same things we are doing again and again.

array=[2,3,5,7,1,8]
array=[1,3,5,7,2,8]
array=[1,2,5,7,3,8]
array=[1,2,3,7,5,8]
array=[1,2,3,5,7,8]
